# Blockchain based Organ Transplant DApp on Ethereum
 OT Chain aims to streamline the organ donation and transplantation process, ensuring transparency, traceability, and increased efficiency. It allows for registration  of donors and recipients and automatically  matches them based on organ type, blood group, medical urgency, and waiting time. The  matching process results in the minting of an NFT (ERC-721 token), representing the transplant, which is then transferred to the recipient.
